# EvilTriangle

Using OpenGL, triangles get rendered to the screen to create a scene.

To use, you can clone the whole repository and use the Code::Blocks files made, or if you know what you're doing, simply take the main.cpp file. Keep in mind the dependencies as some of them require additional downloads.
